Title: Structural, Modal , Buckling Analysis of CubeSat Satellite Frame Using ANSYS Workbench

Objective:

The primary objective of this study is to perform a comprehensive structural analysis of a CubeSat satellite frame using three different materials (Al 5056 H-32, Al 6061-T6, and Al 7075-T6) to determine the most suitable material for the frame.

Specific Objectives:

1. Conduct basic structural analysis.
2. Identify the optimal material.
3. Finalize a structural design for the selected material.

Methodology:

The analysis was performed using ANSYS Workbench, encompassing:

1. Static Structural Analysis.
2. Modal Analysis.
3. Pre-stressed Modal Analysis.
4. Buckling Analysis.

Results:

The analysis yielded the following results:

- Total Deformation.
- X, Y, and Z Deformation.
- Equivalent Stress.
- Equivalent Strain.
- Six natural frequency modes.
- Buckling Load Factor.

Conclusion:

After analyzing the results, Aluminium 7075-T6 was selected as the optimal material for the CubeSat satellite frame due to its superior structural properties.

Software Skills:

- ANSYS Mechanical FEA Software.
- ANSYS Workbench.
